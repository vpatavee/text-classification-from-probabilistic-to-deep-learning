    "# Word Embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "In Notebook 1, we represent a document with a vector whose size is equal to the the size of vocabulary set. We encoded each words with one hot encoding technique which assign a value in the vector at index corresponding to the vocabulary and leave other elements zero. This technique has several drawbacks. It creates sparseness in vector space. It also cannot capture two different words that are synonym or similar, or share some sort of relations. For example, word `cat` and `dog` will totally different, as different as words like `electrical` and `poem`. These weaknesses can undermine downstream tasks. To solve these issues, researcher comes up with [dense representation](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/6.pdf) to be contrast with the sparseness of one hot encoding. Several approaches on dense representation have been studies since 1990s and culminated at the invention of [Word2Vec](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5021-distributed-representations-of-words-and-phrases-and-their-compositionality.pdf) in 2013. The technique (seemingly, since it's still controversial) outperforms previous dense representation techniques discovered in 1990s for many downstream tasks. Our experiment will be center on pre-trained [Word2Vec] by exploring different ways of using it and their performances.\n",

    "In Notebook 1, we do text preprocessing to reduce number of features. For example, words like `Movie`, `movie` and `movies` share the same meaning and play the same role in classification model, so we do lowercase and lemmatization to group them together. We also remove stop words and number because we believe that they don't play any roles in classification mode. However, this is not necessary the case for word embeddings. In pre-trained Word2Vec, it has embeddings for `Movie`, `movie` and `movies` and those embeddings are very similar. Furthermore, embeddings can encode subtle different of words like `good`, `better` and `best`. We will see if text processing is not necessary for text classification with word embeddings. "

The idea is that the words that present frequently across document e.g. `is`, `that` convey less information that words that rarely present, so they should be assigned less number. However, since text classification is supervise learning, it is possible that the classification model can learn the same information (which words, or which feature in vector space, are more important than others). In this experiment, we will see if TFIDF is useful for classification problem."

    "# Experiment 4 - Pooling\n",
    "\n",
    "While reading the first three experiments in this Notebook, you may be wondering that Word embeddings (Word2Vec and GloVE) are dense representation of \"words\" not \"document\", so how can we come up with vectors representing document? To do so, we have to pool word embeddings, similar idea as pooling layer in CNN. In the first three experiments, we simply average the embeddings of each tokens to get the vector representing the document. While this technique is so simple, it has been widely used. Not only in academic, but industrial NLP library such as spaCy [doc vector](https://spacy.io/api/doc#vector) and [BERT-AS-A-SERVICE](https://github.com/hanxiao/bert-as-service#speech_balloon-faq) also pool a document vector by averaging. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "However, averaging is not the only way we can pool a document vector. Let's step back a little to the fundamental. What do we do in Notebook 1? We use one-hot encoding to encode a word and then we sum them up! Although our word representation is now embeddings (dense) instead of one-hot encoding (sparse), we can still do the same thing. The reason why averaging is more popular is that it eliminate the effect of document length. For example, these two documents `cat cat dog dog` and `cat dog` will be the same in vector space. Another technique is to use log, as presented in this [book](https://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/pdf/06vect.pdf). The idea is to reduce the effect of token that occur many times. For example, the document like `dog dog dog cat` will lean toward `dog` in vector space if we average.  However, it will lean toward `dog` in less degree if we use log pooling technique. However, this log technique is introduced for Information Retrieval context, which is determining the query vector and document vector. As our problem set is text classification, this technique may not work. \n",
    "\n",
    "One may speculate that averaging and summing are pretty much the same since we just multiply vectors with some constants. This may be true for information retrieval since `sim(q, d)` and `sim(q, c x d)` are the same where `sim` is cosine similarity. However, for classification we are to draw a boundary in vector space, and since by taking average we multiply those vectors with different constants (each document can have different length), it can change to decision boundary. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that all these variations are Bag Of Word, which does not take the position of words into account. In other words `The movie is not good. It is boring` and `The movie is not boring. It is good` are represented with the same vector.\n",
